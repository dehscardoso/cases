# Risk Analyst I Case Study

This repository contains a project completed as part of a job application for the position of Risk Analyst I at CloudWalk. The project focuses on analyzing and modeling risk using a Jupyter notebook.

## Project Overview

The **Risk Analyst I Case Study** project aims to demonstrate proficiency in:

- Data analysis and exploration techniques
- Feature engineering for risk assessment
- Building and evaluating predictive models
- Communicating findings and recommendations

The main components of the project include:

- **Data Analysis**: Exploring the dataset to understand its structure, identifying key variables, and assessing data quality.
  
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating relevant features to improve the predictive power of the models.
  
- **Modeling**: Building machine learning models to predict risk, comparing different algorithms, and selecting the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
  
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics and visualizations.

## Files

- `Risk-Analyst-I-Case.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete analysis, from data exploration to model evaluation.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used in the analysis.

## Getting Started

To run the notebook locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/dehscardoso/cases.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd cases/CloudWalk%20-%20Risck%20Analyst%20I/
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. Open the `Risk-Analyst-I-Case.ipynb` notebook and execute each cell to reproduce the analysis.
